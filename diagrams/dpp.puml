title Decentralized LCA Participation Protocol\nConcrete Supply Chain Example with 4 Companies
participant "Company1\n**Initiator**" as A
participant "Order Provider\n(OP)" as OP
participant "Company2" as B
participant "Company3" as C
participant "Company4" as D
participant "Computation Party 1\n(CP1)" as CP1
participant "Computation Party 2\n(CP2)" as CP2
participant "Computation Party 3\n(CP3)" as CP3
== Phase 1 & 2: Registration and Notification Phase ==
A -> A : Generate calculationID = "calc_12345"
A -> OP : registerEntity(calc_12345, 5)
OP --> A : index_A = 1
A -> B : Send (calc_12345, 5)
A -> D : Send (calc_12345, 5)
B -> OP : registerEntity(calc_12345)
OP --> B : index_B = 2
B -> C : Send (calc_12345)
D -> OP : registerEntity(calc_12345)
OP --> D : index_D = 3
C -> OP : registerEntity(calc_12345)
OP --> C : index_C = 4
== Phase 3: Share Creation Following Algorithm Logic ==
